# All-Terrain Wheelchair

The goal of this project is to help Jason, our sponsor who is disabled, increase his mobility. As an avid outdoors man, he needs a way to walk his dog, go to the beach, etc. His current wheelchair cannot traverse through rough terrain and he has requested us to design and build an all terrain electric wheelchair for him.

My team talked to him and asked him what he needs out of this wheelchair and transformed his user needs into engineering requirements.
