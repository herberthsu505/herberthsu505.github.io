# Canine Crash Dummies

The goal of this project is to develop dog crash test dummies for dynamic testing of automotive pet harnesses and carriers.

Design Process:

Conduct research on canine anthropometry and characterize the size and weight requirements for the crash dummy
Design a canine crash dummy based on the research conducted while also address the weaknesses of previous designs
Build and test the newly designed dummy.

My research group decided to focus on medium-large sized breeds.

Design specifications:
- Weight: ~80 pounds
- Height: ~24 inches
- Length: ~27 inches
- Width: ~13 inches
Fabrication Methods: milling, lathing, welding, water jetting, welding, and 3D printing.

Future Work:

- Conduct more in-depth research into the weight distribution of dogs and insert lead weights in appropriate places.
- Design better head attachment that looks more like a dog.
- Cover metal structure with form-fitting foam and fabric to avoid damage to the harness during testing
- Test the dummy on the impact sled to determine weakness in the structure
