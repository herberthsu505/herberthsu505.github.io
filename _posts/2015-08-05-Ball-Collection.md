The goal of this project is to design and build an automated mechanism which can catch balls from two chutes and sort them into the correct place based on color.

We first utilized ADAMS to optimize the position of the four bar linkage based on the motor power and weight.

The final designs are shown below. The slot in the ball catcher is reserved for the color sensor.

Wiring diagram for the color sensor and motor. PID controls are used to control the position and speed/torque of the motor.
