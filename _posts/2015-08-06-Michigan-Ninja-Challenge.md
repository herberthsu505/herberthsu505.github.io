# ME 250: Design and Manufacturing I, Michigan Ninja Challenge (2017)

The main challenge for the robot was to navigate across a narrow bridge around the perimeter of the zone, or wade through a shallow lake of ping-pong balls to deliver the cubes to the next zone. Working in groups of 4. We combined our design ideas based on the requirements and constraints.
