# ME 250: Design and Manufacturing I, Michigan Ninja Challenge (2017)

The main challenge for the robot was to navigate across a narrow bridge around the perimeter of the zone, or wade through a shallow lake of ping-pong balls to deliver the cubes to the next zone. Working in groups of 4. We combined our design ideas based on the requirements and constraints.

We used a Arduino Mega to control 4 800W In-Hub BLDC motors with e-bike motor controllers to control each motor independently.

The system is powered by 16 LiFeP04 3.2 V batteries, monitored by BMS, giving us total of 48V at 40AH. We designed and 3D printed the joystick.
